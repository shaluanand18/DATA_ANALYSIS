   <h3>Data Organization:</h3><br>
Project data is separated into four folders: "COVID_data", "Govt_Data", "CAR_sales_data", and "Stock_Data". <br>
<br>
   <h3>Code organization:</h3><br>
"Working_Notebooks" is a folder containing the individual workbooks of team members. These notebooks were merged into a file named "Working_Master".<br>
<br>
Plot formatting changes were made in the Working_Master along with minor edits. The images from the plots were saved in a folder named "Images".<br>
<br>
The "Working_Master" was copied as "Master_Notebook".  Unused plots and code were culled.<br>
<br>
